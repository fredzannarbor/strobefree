# strobefree

In December 2016 Newsweek writer Kurt Eichenwald was subjected to a particularly vile Twitter attack in which a strobing GIF was sent to him to trigger an epileptic attack. It should be possible to create a browser plugin that passes normal GIFs and images but blocks or destrobes dangerous images. I believe imagemagick or a similar library should be able to accomplish this.  Such a plugin would benefit both Kurt and the many people who are highly photosensitive.  This page is a placeholder to organize a team effort to build such a plugin.  This project is a bit over my head so contributors are not only welcome but essential--we need a leader to step forward.
